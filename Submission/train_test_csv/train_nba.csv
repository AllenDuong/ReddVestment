[Matt Barnes] I love Lonzo Ball. His quickness, his defense, he's tough, [I] love him, his confidence with his shooting; he changes the dynamic of the game; his first step is incredible, his anticipation on defense is incredible, his ball defense is incredible, so I really like what he's doing.`474

[Albert Nahmad] Most NBA teams can claim Carmelo Anthony off waivers, sign him if he were to clear waivers, or trade for him on or after 12/15. The only exceptions: (i) Hawks cant sign him or claim him off waivers, and (ii) Thunder cant sign him, acquire him off waivers or trade for him.`32

[Amick] According to a source, Fultz shuffled the ball on the way up of a FT in an attempt to block out the yips. A source said that concern about his injury causes him to double clutch, fearful the ball may slip. At this point, it's as much a mental hurdle as it's a physical one.`120
[Mannix] Fultz has zero leverage to force his way out of Philadelphia. He's under a rookie scale contract for at least the next two seasons, and the Sixers would be foolish to move him now, when his trade value is at rock bottom.`144
Before we start flooding the sub with a ton of Fultz trade proposals, can we all discuss what his trade value is?`7
