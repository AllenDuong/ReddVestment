## General Description
A web app where users view posts from a specified subreddit and invest in one of five new posts. Users win points if their post gains karma over the course of approximately 12 hours.

## Advanced Functions
- Post prediction: When a user is prompted with posts, ReddVestment will tell the user which post it predicts will perform the best over 12 hours. This was accomplished by way of a regression model trained on hundreds of thousands of Reddit posts.
- Multiplayer: Users can add other users as friends and can challenge them to a battle of memes. Whoever chooses the more successful of five posts wins! Users can view leaderboards of their friends and of the whole website.
