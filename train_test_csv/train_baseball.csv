[Rosenthal] Sources: #Mets talks with #Mariners on Cano-Diaz reaching critical stage. NYM offer includes some but not all of Kelenic, Dunn, McNeil, Bruce, Swarzak. SEA believed to be weighing proposal against others. Also figure to include money to cover additional part of $120M owed Cano.`412
Just one day, please`2
[Sherman] Source: #Mariners and #Mets talks intensifying to bring Cano/Diaz to NYM. Still have money, medicals and no trade clauses to work on but Sea is now focused on the Mets. Swarzak/Bruce likely to offer some financial counterweight.`25

[Sherman] Heard: Earlier this week #Mets were mulling offer that was Kelenic, Dunn, Bruce, Swarzak for Cano/Diaz/$. Didnt have much traction and McNeil not in it. Wonder if NYM tried subbing McNeil for Kelenic. And possible prospects are based on how much of Canos $ willing to eat.`40

[Heyman] To update: mets, #SFGiants are among others to check in on realmuto in recent weeks (preference is to trade JT out of division but its not quite an absolute)`42
[Passan] A quick look at the $ ... Mets get: - Robinson Cano: 5 years, $120M Mariners get: - Jay Bruce: 2 years, $26M - Anthony Swarzak: 1 year, $8M Mets are taking on $86M. Plus Diaz should make somewhere from $30M-$35M over the next four seasons, should he remain an elite closer.`54

Over 640 former major league players--including a decorated 96-year old Battle of the Bulge veteran--don't receive pensions from baseball`27

[Sherman] No one's given me a clue how much #Mariners are eating of Cano. But they're taking on $37M in Bruce/Swarzak. My bet (and it is only a hunch) they'll eat another $23M so NYM pay $60M - half of current $120M owed. Still probably twice as much as he would get if he were a fr agt`78
